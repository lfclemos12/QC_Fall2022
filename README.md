This program aims to simulate a class registration program similar to those at
many American universities.

Users can perform a number of command line inputs to add students to classes, 
view student info, and view class info, among other operations.

The program makes use of a number of data structures, e.g. BinarySearchTrees, 
sorted LinkedLists, Queues; the implementations of which can be found in the
'myDataStructures' folder.

Files pertinent to the main program can be found in the 'school' folder.
